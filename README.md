# PS4 Unjail Plugin Unity Native Code

This is the source code for the Unjail method converted into a Unity Plugin to be used in Unity PS4 for homebrew development.

Open the SLN file into Visual Studio 2015. Be sure you've got the corresponding SDK to build this.

When you compile it you will get in the upper folder of the project a new folder named Plugins. That folder has to be copied into Assets folder of Unity Project.

That's all.
